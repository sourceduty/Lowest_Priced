[Lowest Priced](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-R0zmXmfcw-lowest-priced) is designed to help users find the best deals on products by considering both the absolute lowest price and the best relative value. When searching for the absolute lowest price, this GPT focuses solely on finding the lowest possible cost for a product, which may sometimes mean sacrificing factors like faster shipping or seller reputation. On the other hand, the relative lowest price approach considers additional elements, such as shipping costs, retailer reputation, and product reviews, offering a more balanced recommendation that can be both cost-effective and reliable. By weighing these two approaches, users receive not only the cheapest options but also a clear picture of potential trade-offs.

To ensure that recommendations are both affordable and of reasonable quality, this GPT excludes products from retailers known for poor service or reliability issues. This approach aims to give users confidence in their purchases, presenting cost-saving options without sacrificing too much on quality or shopping experience. Additionally, this GPT gently reminds users to recheck prices, as they can fluctuate over time, ensuring that users make the most informed decisions. The goal is to strike a balance between affordability and dependability, providing users with a comprehensive view of both budget-friendly and sensible options.
